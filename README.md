# Anchor Take Home - Audio/Video Player

I decided to use the create-react-app package to quickly get my dev enviroment up and running with a few tweaks. I added in Typescript for type safety and it generally makes my code much cleaner. I
also added in scss as a preprocessor and css module support to help keep my styles organized and to separate concerns.

### Assumptions Made

- I made the player self contained, assuming that the component was part of a larger app. Hence why I decided against using Redux for state management. Local state management works just fine in this exercise.

- The player is responsive for various screen sizes.

### What I Would Have Done

- Add unit and snapshot tests for the player and its child components.

### Sources

- Used this design as inspiration for the player. https://dribbble.com/shots/3637051-Music-Player
